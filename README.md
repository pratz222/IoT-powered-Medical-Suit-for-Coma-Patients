# IoT-powered-Medical-Suit-for-Coma-Patients
This innovative suit seamlessly integrates an array of sensors to gather vital data on a patient's heart rate, brain activity, muscle movement, body temperature, and even position. This real-time information is securely transmitted to a cloud platform for remote access by authorized personnel, including doctors, family members, and caregivers, through a user-friendly mobile app.
